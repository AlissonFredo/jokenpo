## About
Jokenp√¥ (or Rock, Paper, Scissors) is a simple and popular hand game, usually played between two people. The basic objective of the game is to defeat the opponent by choosing one of the three available gestures, following these rules:

- Rock beats Scissors (rock crushes scissors)
- Scissors beats Paper (scissors cuts paper)
- Paper beats Rock (paper covers rock)

If both players choose the same gesture, the game ends in a tie.
